# Google Cloud Console Service Account Setup for Google Drive API Access

This document outlines the process for creating a service account, enabling the Google Drive API, and managing service account keys in Google Cloud Console.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project.
- Permissions to manage IAM & Admin settings in the Google Cloud Console.

## Steps

### 1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**

- Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Make sure you are in the correct project where you want to set up the service account.

### 2. **Navigate to IAM & Admin**

- In the left sidebar, navigate to **IAM & Admin**.
- Select **Service Accounts** from the dropdown list.

### 3. **Create a New Service Account**

- Click the **Create Service Account** button at the top of the Service Accounts page.
- **Enter the Service Account Name** (e.g., `google-drive-api-service`).
- Optionally, add a description (e.g., "Service account for Google Drive API").
- Click **Create**.

### 4. **Assign Roles to the Service Account**

- In the **Grant this service account access to project** section, assign appropriate roles for Google Drive API.
  - Typically, you would assign the role `Editor` or a more specific role like `Drive API User` depending on your requirements.
- Click **Continue**.

### 5. **Create Service Account Keys**

- In the next step, you can **Create Key** for your service account.
- Select the key type as **JSON**.
- Click **Create** to download the JSON key file. Save this file securely as it will allow you to authenticate using the service account.

### 6. **Enable Google Drive API**

- Go to the **API & Services** section in the Google Cloud Console.
- Click on **Library**.
- Search for **Google Drive API**.
- Click on **Google Drive API** in the search results.
- Click **Enable** to enable the API for your project.

### 7. **Access the Service Account Keys**

- Once the service account is created, you can manage the keys through the Service Account page.
- Click on the **Service Account** you just created to access its details.
- Under the **Keys** section, you will see the list of keys associated with the service account.
  - You can **add new keys** or **delete** existing ones as required.
  - To access the keys directly, you can use the following URL (replace with your project and service account ID):
    ```
    https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/details/[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID]/keys?project=[PROJECT_ID]
    ```

### 8. **Grant Service Account Permissions in Google Drive**

- If the service account needs access to a specific Google Drive file or folder, you will need to **share the file/folder** with the service account's email address (e.g., `service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
- Go to the Google Drive file or folder, right-click, and choose **Share**.
- Enter the service account email and assign the appropriate permissions.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the downloaded JSON key file is stored securely, as it contains sensitive authentication information.
- If you need to revoke a key, you can delete it from the Google Cloud Console IAM > Service Accounts page.
